 * ### Implementation
 *
 * We have implemented the constructor for you in a way that makes sense with our reference solution. You are free to
 * change anything you would like here if it doesn't fit with you implementation.
 *
 * Be warned, though! If you stray too far away from our guidance, it will be much harder for us to help you. Our
 * recommendation would be to first implement the buffer pool manager using the stepping stones we have provided.
 *
 * Once you have a fully working solution (all Gradescope test cases pass), then you can try more interesting things!
 *
 * @param num_frames The size of the buffer pool.
 * @param disk_manager The disk manager.
 * @param k_dist The backward k-distance for the LRU-K replacer.
 * @param log_manager The log manager. Please ignore this for P1.

 *
 * Once you have allocated the new page via the counter, make sure to call `DiskScheduler::IncreaseDiskSpace` so you
 * have enough space on disk!

 *
 * ### Implementation
 *
 * Think about all of the places a page or a page's metadata could be, and use that to guide you on implementing this
 * function. You will probably want to implement this function _after_ you have implemented `CheckedReadPage` and
 * `CheckedWritePage`.
 *
 * Ideally, we would want to ensure that all space on disk is used efficiently. That would mean the space that deleted
 * pages on disk used to occupy should somehow be made available to new pages allocated by `NewPage`.
 *
 * If you would like to attempt this, you are free to do so. However, for this implementation, you are allowed to
 * assume you will not run out of disk space and simply keep allocating disk space upwards in `NewPage`.
 *
 * For (nonexistent) style points, you can still call `DeallocatePage` in case you want to implement something slightly
 * more space-efficient in the future.

 * ### Implementation
 *
 * You should probably leave implementing this function until after you have completed `CheckedReadPage` and
 * `CheckedWritePage`, as it will likely be much easier to understand what to do.

 * @brief Retrieves the pin count of a page. If the page does not exist in memory, return `std::nullopt`.

 *
 * This function is intended for testing purposes. If this function is implemented incorrectly, it will definitely cause
 * problems with the test suite and autograder.
 *
 * # Implementation
 *
 * We will use this function to test if your buffer pool manager is managing pin counts correctly. Since the
 * `pin_count_` field in `FrameHeader` is an atomic type, you do not need to take the latch on the frame that holds the
 * page we want to look at. Instead, you can simply use an atomic `load` to safely load the value stored. You will still
 * need to take the buffer pool latch, however.
 *
 * Again, if you are unfamiliar with atomic types, see the official C++ docs
 * [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic).
